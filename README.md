# GachaGears

This is a personal project to learn the MERN stack.
This web app is used to create a list of builds for the game Honkai Star Rail (and other games in the future).

Game information (Characters, Relics, Ornaments, Zones) and admin builds are stored in a MongoDB database.

Builds added by the users are added locally to the localStorage and are attached to api calls for processing.
